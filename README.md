My Sketchbook
=============

This is my sketchbook folder for [Processing](http://www.processing.org) sketches. I wanted a bit of version control for my sketches and thought they might be interesting to look at, so Github is their new home.

Feel free to make use of the code, but let me know if you end up using it in anything cool, because that would be awesome.

Just going to put a link to an exported sketch here, which I've put up on the project pages.
